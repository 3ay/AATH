Feature: RFC 0183 Aries agent credential revocation and revocation notification

   Background: create a schema and credential definition in order to issue a credential
      Given "Acme" has a public did
      And "Acme" is ready to issue a credential

   Scenario Outline: Credential revoked by Issuer and Holder attempts to prove with a prover that doesn't care if it was revoked
      Given "2" agents
         | name  | role     |
         | Bob   | prover   |
         | Faber | verifier |

      And "Bob" has an issued credential from <issuer> with <credential_data>
      When <issuer> revokes the credential
      And "Faber" sends a <request_for_proof> presentation to "Bob"
      And "Bob" makes the <presentation> of the proof
      And "Faber" acknowledges the proof
      Then "Bob" has the proof verified
