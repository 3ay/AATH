# RUNSET_NAME: "ACA-PY to AF-.NET"
# Scope: AIP 1.0
# Exceptions: Proof Proposals
#
# Summary
#
# This runset uses the current main branch of ACA-Py for all of the agents except Bob (holder),
# which uses the master branch of Aries Framework .NET. The runset covers all of the AIP 1.0 tests that 
# are known to work with the Aries Framework .NET as the holder along with Revocation tests. Excluded 
# are those tests that involve Proof Proposals.
#
# Current
# 
# The majority of tests are running and passing. T013-HIPE0011 is failing due to the Aries Framework Dotnet not supporting
# presentations containing a non-revocation interval, with a non-revocable credential. This issue is being tracked in 
# https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet/issues/184
# 
# *Status Note Updated: 2021.04.08*
